# Password-Generator - Bootcamp Week 5

## Intermediate JavaScript: Password Generator

This project uses JavaScript to randomly generate a password based on criteria selected by user input.

The page will generate a password when the button is clicked. The user is prompted for a series of criteria, including:


Length of password: At least 10 characters but no more than 64.

Character types: Lowercase, Uppercase, Numeric, Special characters ($@%&*, etc.)

The code validates for each input and at least one character type should be selected.

Once all prompts are answered, the password is generated and displayed on the page.

## Usage

Here is a mock up of the page:
